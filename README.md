# SecRef

A clean, no-BS directory of cybersecurity resources. 

Visit: https://secref.org

## What is this?

Instead of bookmarking 500 different security sites, just bookmark this one. It's a simple directory that organizes tools, learning resources, communities, and everything else security-related.

No ads. No tracking. No user accounts. Just links.

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Contributing

The site is built with Astro and deploys automatically when you push to main.
