# Contributing to SecRef

Thank you for your interest in contributing to SecRef! This project aims to be the most comprehensive cybersecurity resource hub, and we welcome contributions from the community.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Issues

- **Security Issues**: Please see our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md)
- **Bugs**: Open an issue with a clear description and steps to reproduce
- **Feature Requests**: Open an issue describing the feature and its value

### 2. Adding or Updating Resources

The easiest way to contribute is by adding new cybersecurity resources or updating existing ones.

#### Resource Format

Resources are stored as JSON in `src/data/`. Each resource should include:

```json
{
  "name": "Tool Name",
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "description": "Clear, concise description",
  "type": "free|paid|freemium|enterprise",
  "notation": "(F)â€ ",  // If applicable
  "pricingNote": "Free tier: X, Pro: $Y/month",
  "isCommunityFavorite": false,
  "isIndustryStandard": false,
  "tags": ["category", "use-case"],
  "platforms": ["windows", "linux", "macos"]
}
```

#### Resource Guidelines

- **Accuracy**: Verify all information is current and correct
- **Neutrality**: Use objective descriptions without marketing language
- **Completeness**: Include all relevant fields
- **Categories**: Place resources in appropriate categories
- **Quality**: Only add high-quality, actively maintained resources
